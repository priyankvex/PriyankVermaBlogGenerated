<p>Last week in one of my project I wanted to store data of a form having more than 100 fields. I knew storing this much scattered info on relational DBs would be tough. Platform being mobile, just made things more complicated. Indications were to use a NoSql DB.</p>

<p>For  what I found, Couchbase lite is the best NoSql database for mobile. It is available for both Android and ios platform and thus creating apps for both platforms becomes easy.</p>

<p>The usage of DB was pretty advance and thus I decided to take the courses offered by Couchbase. I took 2 courses :</p>

<pre><code>  1. **CB020 : Fundamentals of NoSql data management**
  2. **CB140 : Couchbase lite for mobile **
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CB020 : Fundamentals of NoSql data managment</strong></p>

<p>This course was pretty basic. It covered what is big data, why scattered data can not be stored in RDBs and how NoSql is a life savior in these situations.</p>

<p>Most interesting concept was CAP theorem.</p>

<p>**C : Consistency , **</p>

<p>**A : Availability **</p>

<p><strong>P : Partition Tolerance</strong></p>

<p>It says that in a database you can achieve any two.</p>

<p><strong>C and P : MongoDB and Couchbase</strong></p>

<p><strong>C and A : MySql and Oracle</strong></p>

<p><strong>A and P : Apache,  HBase</strong></p>

<p><strong>CB140 :</strong> <strong>Couchbase Mobile</strong></p>

<p>This one covered basics of couchbase lite, a mobile NoSql database. Pretty simple to use.</p>

<p>On Android projects it can be added as gradle dependency and the APIs are also well equipped and easy to use.</p>

<p>Couchbase being a document based database provides a document based storage which are used to store data as JSON.</p>

<p>Course covered reading documents, updating and deleting documents. What is couchbase server and what is sync gateway. With code samples being presented and explained, you&rsquo;ll get good hold of couchbase in short period of time.</p>

<p>Both the ** **courses took me around 6 hours to complete and the time I&rsquo;ll save by not writing buggy code will be much more than this.</p>
