  <h1>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : Reading Experience</h1>

<p>The Japanese motorcycle maintenance guide says “ Assembly of Japanese bicycle requires great piece of mind”. There is a thing about everything you build, including bikes. If you build it with non-serene mind, then you build your problems into it.</p>

<p>The book takes you on a cross country bike journey that will teach you mind opening lessons that leave lasting impressions on your mind. Your mind will simple refuse to contract itself to older stage.</p>

<p>One of the most important lesson that book teaches you is to enjoy the common little things that life has for you. There is as much Buddha in cogs of bike, as there is at the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of the book the author says, “If you want to set out for the most amazing bike journey, you have learn the art of motorcycle maintenance.” The quote has so many meanings at different levels that your mind can explore the words in infinite ways.</p>

<p>As the bike journey progresses, author makes the point that the key to be doing great work is to be completely involved in it. Not like mechanics who listen music while working on the bike with no intention to make it great, the noise of the tools should be music.</p>

<p>How we see the world affects how we think about it. There are two ways to see the world, the classical way where everything is logical and the other is the romantic way.</p>

<p>**Classical way of thinking **runs the knife on views, something is cut. And when the logic in the logic is found, the beauty of the unknown is lost.</p>

<p>**Romantic way of thinking **is all about enjoying the continuum of things.</p>

<p>**Quality **is the thing that author says that you know what it is, but still you can not define it. Like you know what makes a tomato soup good, but yet you can not define what makes up its quality, both materialistic and spiritual.</p>

<p>World consists of three things : Mind, Matter and Quality.</p>

<p>The author was a student of University of California at one point, before his nervous breakdown. Studying there he made some amazing point on the thinking of Plato and Aristotle. How dialectic way of thinking is different from rhetoric way of thinking, but at the same time one doesn’t proves the other wrong.</p>

<p>My two the favorite quotes from the book are :</p>

<pre><code>  1. “The only zen you’ll find at the top of the mountain, is the zen you take with you”.
  2. “The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. There isn’t any other test. If the machine produces tranquillity it’s right. If it disturbs you it’s wrong until either the machine or your mind is changed.”
</code></pre>

<p>This is the best book that I have ever read. No matter what you are doing in your life and how old are you, this books touches your mind at levels so deep that you didn’t even think it was possible. But you’ll have to keep the beginner’s mind to learn.</p>

<p>As the author states, “sometimes it is better to travel than to arrive”. I was carried away with the philosophical ideas presented in the book and the serenity that the country side description provides.</p>

<p>Knowing that Chris, the son of the author, with whom he set out for this bike journey is dead was a little sad. But again in snap that increases the importance of all the lesson and the author was expounding throughout the book about life and zen.</p>

<p>A recommended read for everyone.</p>

<p>The next book that I have picked is “The Blue Ocean Strategy”.</p>
