<p>This was the book that I knew prior to reading it that it won&rsquo;t be too interesting and might even feel too slow. I searched it on the internet and picked it to read to get a perspective of a retail seller. As me and my team are trying to start a company that will work very closely with retail stores and their owners I thought this book will provide some value.</p>

<p>What I liked about this book how it delivers simple and effective tactics that a store owner can use to create customer loyalty, make lasting seller-customer relationships and compete against online retail giants.</p>

<p>It compares getting customers to getting a girlfriend. They are demanding and they want to feel special or else they&rsquo;ll move on.</p>

<p>It brings focus on few very effective retail techniques like bag stuffers and doughnut marketing. It also covers basics of copywriting and its importance.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t like about the book was that it was too slow and dumb at times. As a young person who is aware of technology world you&rsquo;ll feel few things too stupid to be covered in that detail in the book. May be that&rsquo;s a better fit for old shop owners.</p>

<p>Overall it was a good read. Not as per my expectations but still can give you an image of a mind of a retailer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely use the concepts of this book in my company as me and my team too believe that the best shopping experience for a customer can be provided at a local retail store. All they need  is a power up and better tools now.</p>

<p>My next book is &ldquo;How to win friends and influence people&rdquo;. Will share my experience about that too when&rsquo;ll be done.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
