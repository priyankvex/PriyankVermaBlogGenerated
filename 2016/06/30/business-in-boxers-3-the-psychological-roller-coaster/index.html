  <h1>Business In Boxers 3 : The Psychological Roller Coaster</h1>
  <time datetime=2016-06-30T18:58:30Z class="post-date">Thu, Jun 30, 2016</time>
  <p>One of my favorite things about instrumental music is that the listener is encouraged to use his or her imagination. I have been a huge Owl City and Adam Young fan since forever. Lately he is releasing sets of instrumental music called as Adam Young Scores inspired by incidents that made a lasting impression on the world.  Reading about all those incidents has made a lasting impression on my mind for sure, our small failures and success doesn&rsquo;t even matter to the world, we have got to make it large.</p>

<p>This month has been a wacky psychological roller coaster. A slow motion wave on the ocean stirring my emotion up like a rain cloud. When you are trying to start something new and you know odds are against you I guess this happens, you become very paranoid in some sense. Each blow shakes your confidence and you have to build that up again. It&rsquo;s exhausting some time. Here is where a nice snack helps :D</p>

<p><img src="https://priyankvex.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_20160619_122004.jpg?w=660" alt="IMG_20160619_122004" /></p>

<p>At start of this month we all were very keen towards making the MVP (minimum viable product) ready but my mentor and CEO of the startup where I am working suggested to do a market research and look for idea validation. So one afternoon me and my friend visited few shops and tried to convey the idea to them . Very few got the idea and showed interest. I guess demography plays a vital role here. We all made peace with it that we will need real tangible product to make people excited about it.</p>

<p>But soon things got hard. Workload at intern got high and juggling both my startup and intern got really difficult. This made me think that how hard it would be to manage it with a full-time job. This was the first blow. And soon other members of team took off for exams or campus preparation or god knows what excuse.</p>

<p>Lately realized that to become good entrepreneur you should know the shit you are dealing with. Though I know that we learn stuff on the way, but still first we should invest in our-self. That&rsquo;s why I am learning rails and other things needed to run the company. Attention to details will cause a momentarily pain in the ass. But it will be worth all the while.</p>

<p>As an overview all startups working on similar domain look the same. It is the one who really dig deeper and strive for great brand experience that makes all the difference. This what I believe in and want to do.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I took sales course before going to sellers for local survey. This is why I was studying business plan of Vinod Khosla to know and set my goals. This is why I am honing my technical skills. It all comes down to this, you should believe that whatever you are doing can be hard, but in the end it will be worth all the while.</p>

<p>I guess now we are on track now. Now that I have stopped counting on the members who were just pretending to be part of the team, I can be sure of what we can do in certain time. We are now clear to drop every operation and just build the damn product. Period. After 8 months I&rsquo;ll be graduating and I want to be ready with a use-able product before that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am also trying to concrete the company goals. So that we can start moving. Breaking down to achievable goals with deadlines and metrics to measure how we are moving.</p>

<p>One more habit I am trying to develop is to write down my very specific goals for the day twice. In morning and at evening. It kinda helps you keep track. I have also started to workout and exercise more regularly than I used to, it&rsquo;s good to do more of what makes you feel good about yourself because it reflects in all the other things that you do.</p>

<p>I am still not properly over of thinking whether I am making the right bets or not, I guess you can never tell. It like I am on emotional state of PMS.</p>

<p>But I know one thing for sure, whatever you do your job is to tell the story.</p>

<p>Thanks. See you next time.</p>
