  <h1>Business in Boxers : 1 Month Into Running a StartUp</h1>
  <time datetime=2016-03-22T20:49:58Z class="post-date">Tue, Mar 22, 2016</time>
  <p>**Why the Series? **</p>

<p>(Inspired by book : Business In Blue Jeans)</p>

<p>Hi! This is Priyank. This series is about me pen downing my start-up ride. Don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s fast or slow, all I really know is I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy the ride.</p>

<p><strong>Why the name?</strong></p>

<p>Boxers is what you&rsquo;ll find me almost every time in and business is what&rsquo;s always in my mind and thus the name &ldquo;Business In Boxers&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>The Beginning</strong></p>

<p>Last month on 15th Feb, me and my friend sat down seriously deciding on which business to start. The interesting thing was I did this with 3 friends. 3 awesome business ideas that are practical and scalable. Next, we 4 formed a team. A team with a vision to launch multiple businesses in a very short period of time.</p>

<p>Our first startup what we call as **Pebbles Media **deals with creating engaging applications for local business owners that can help them discover new customers in their locality. Cool idea that we all thought will get us many clients.</p>

<p>We approached 5 clients in different domains from food business to education to mechanical work. Two of them showed interest and we started working on their products.</p>

<p>15 days later one of our clients refused to pay the advance thus we dropped him. Other client wanted a custom product built for them at a very unreasonable price, again dropped him.</p>

<p><strong>The Pivot</strong></p>

<p>Witnessing all this, we all after 1 hour long discussion decided that it is the time for an early pivot. We never wanted to enter service based B2B sector.</p>

<p>The pivot that will need us to make products that will be used by multiple small businesses and their customers making us a product based company.</p>

<p>A pivot at this early stage raised doubts in our minds but I guess it was the red flag that we all managed to see and decided to pivot and not to run for quick money.</p>

<p><strong>In Love With Business Books</strong></p>

<p>lately I have been reading a lets of business books. Getting ideas and knowing how various aspects of a startup works. My favorite is The Lean Startup. A must read for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>The Speed Breakers</strong></p>

<p>No surprise here, first month has been filled with speed breakers. I was not expecting any smooth ride either. This month we have seen from clients saying no to all saying yes at the same time. Client giving us advance and then we turning him down because we wanted to pivot.</p>

<p><strong>Wrap Up!</strong></p>

<p>This month we dealt with real clients. Realized that we don&rsquo;t want to go into service based sector.</p>

<p>For next month we are planning to get our MVP out in the market and test our leap of faiths. Too much action for next month. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in the store next.</p>

<p>See you next time.</p>

<p>PS : It is fun to write blog when you are pretty certain that no one will read it :D</p>
