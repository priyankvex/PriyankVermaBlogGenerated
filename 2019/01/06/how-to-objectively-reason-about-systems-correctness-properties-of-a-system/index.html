<p>When a new system is to be designed, the first and the most important step is to generally get the expectations from the system to be crystal clear.<br />
Getting this step done correctly lays the foundation for every design iteration that we make and makes sure that the system will deliver to its expectations.<br />
But how do we go about reasoning objectively, what is the system expected to do, or in other terms what guarantees it must make?</p>

<p><a href="https://intravert.co/serve/e2130d1460.72.js">https://intravert.co/serve/e2130d1460.72.js</a></p>

<p>Correctness of a system</p>

<p>To reason about the correctness of a system, we can try listing its <em><strong>properties</strong></em>.<br />
For example, a URL shortener system will have the following properties:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Uniqueness:<br />
Each URL is given a unique shortened URL.</p></li>

<li><p>Availability of generating shortened URL:<br />
If any node is up which can serve the request, every request to generate the shortened URL must be fulfilled within a reasonable time.</p></li>

<li><p>Correct original URL is returned for the shortened URL:<br />
For any shortened URL, the correct original URL is returned.</p></li>

<li><p>Availability of getting the original URL:<br />
If any node is up which can serve the request, every request to get the original URL must return the original URL within a reasonable time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A system can be analyzed for correctness if it adheres to the properties that are expected from it.<br />
But can we be more incisive when defining properties of a system too?</p>

<p>Safety and Liveness</p>

<p>Borrowed from the distributed systems concepts, properties of a system can be distinguished between two kinds of properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Safety Properties  * Liveness properties</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, getting a unique shortened URL for a URL is a safety guarantee, whereas getting a shortened URL for a URL in a reasonable time is a liveness guarantee.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Guarantee</strong><br />
They can be informally defined as &ldquo;nothing bad happens&rdquo;.<br />
More formally, if a safety property is violated, we can point to a particular point in time when it was broken.<br />
Once a safety guarantee has been broken, the damage has been done to the system and we cannot undo it.</p>

<p>Ex, in the example above, we cannot afford our system to generate duplicate shortened URL of 2 different original URL.</p>

<p><strong>Liveness Guarantee</strong><br />
Liveness property is defined as &ldquo;eventually something good happens&rdquo;.<br />
It may not hold true at some point in time, but it can be restored, (ex, by giving a shortened URL back for a given URL).</p>

<p>An advantage of distinguishing between safety and liveness properties is that it helps in dealing with various system models and reason about the correctness of the system.</p>

<p>Safety guarantees must hold true and cannot be broken even in the case of faults like node crashes, network failures. The system must ensure that it never does anything wrong.</p>

<p>However, liveness guarantees can have some caveats. We could say that the system should return a response only if more than 1/3rd of the nodes are up.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>While designing systems, it&rsquo;s always a very important first step to write down all the properties that the system is expected to guarantee.<br />
We can then classify each of those properties under either a safety guarantee or liveness guarantee.<br />
A system must be designed in such a way that the safety guarantees always hold true, even in the case of faults. Liveness guarantees must be served with the best effort.<br />
This gives us a slightly objective way to reason about the correctness of the systems.</p>
