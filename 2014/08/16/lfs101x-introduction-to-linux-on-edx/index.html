  <h1>LFS101x : Introduction to Linux on edX</h1>
  <time datetime=2014-08-16T10:13:09Z class="post-date">Sat, Aug 16, 2014</time>
  

<p>It was this summer when I saw this course LFS101x being offered on edX  by The Linux Foundation.  Both the terms Linux and edX excited me . So I decided to take this course.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience-with-prior-online-courses"><em>My experience with prior online courses</em></h2>

<p>I have taken few online courses on edX and coursera . In both the cases I loved the excitement and knowledge they provide. They were also fun learning and thus worked well for me.</p>

<h2 id="my-background-prior-to-taking-this-course"><em>My background prior to taking this course</em></h2>

<p>Before taking this course I was an average newbie to Linux . All I was having was curiosity and a little knowledge of Linux . Thus I found this course perfect for me.</p>

<p>As being a programmer , I used Linux just for programming purposes. And wanted to expand the arsenal.</p>

<h2 id="the-journey-of-the-course"><em>The journey of the course</em></h2>

<p>The course started on 1 August &lsquo;14 . I took this course on its very first offering.  It was a self-paced course and they provided all the chapters in advance. All chapters were divided into small sections . Each section ends with couple or more questions . There were video demonstrations of all major Linux shell commands which were great to catch the concepts.</p>

<p>It took me 10 days to finish this course  , when I decided to take the final exam which I found pretty easy.</p>

<p>The course content was updated and discussion forums on edX were helpful.</p>

<p>In epitome  it was a great learning  experience and   you will feel like a linux super user at the end ;) .</p>

<h2 id="what-this-course-demands"><em>What this course demands?</em></h2>

<p>It’s easy and alluring to declare that you’re “starting” an online course , but it is equally important not to dwell on it for too long especially if this is your first online course.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean this course requires great effort  . All this course demands is commitment , dedication and will to learn.</p>

<h2 id="final-words"><em>Final words</em></h2>

<p>It was great to be a part of such a massive learning group . Both the knowledge you gain and the community you get in touch with thrills you .</p>

<p>I highly recommend all of you to take this course.</p>

<p>They also provide an <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6e3i3yzhvtoni0/Certificate.pdf">Honor Code</a> certificate for free after scoring more then 70% in the final exam.</p>

<p><strong>You can have a look at my certificate <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6e3i3yzhvtoni0/Certificate.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p>
