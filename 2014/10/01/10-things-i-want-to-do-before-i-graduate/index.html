<p>I am almost half an engineer by this time. Two and a half year and I will be a graduate. Sounds like fun. So I guess this is the best time to reveal 10 things I want to do before I die . Oh! sorry, before I graduate.</p>

<h2 id="1-google-summer-of-code">1. Google Summer Of Code</h2>

<p><img src="http://incf.org/images/activities/teaching-and-training/google-summer-of-code-banner" alt="GSOC" /></p>

<p>Okay. First one should not be a surprise for computer students. Gsoc is like a dream for almost every computer engineering student. There is nothing better then this you get as a student. I am working with python and will try to get through with it into the Gsocers list.</p>

<h2 id="2-go-to-goa">2. Go to Goa</h2>

<p><img src="http://priyankvex.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/7756e-goa1.jpg" alt="Goa" /></p>

<p>Now this should be obvious to every college student. The beach parties and the girls ;). Seems like fun.
I just want to get there and then declare it &ldquo;The World Party!&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="3-try-to-crack-codevita">3. Try to crack Codevita</h2>

<p><img src="http://priyankvex.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/a1510-codevita-2014-teaser-mailer2-mexico4-c312045c060d7d8ec212d6cd34c2273f.jpg" alt="Codevita" /></p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with this one. It is not your fault. It is a coding contest organized by TCS. I am not that much of a hardcore competitive coder but still this thing deserves a shot.</p>

<h2 id="4-go-river-rafting">4. Go River rafting</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.journeymart.com/gifs/holidays-ideas/adventure/rafting-adventure-holidays.jpg" alt="River Rafting" /></p>

<p>Okay! I am really excited for this one. About half a year ago we planned this but few back logs ruined the plans :&lsquo;(. . Let us see when the glory comes to me.</p>

<h2 id="5-complete-the-dragon-ball-series">5. Complete the Dragon Ball series</h2>

<p><img src="http://statici.behindthevoiceactors.com/behindthevoiceactors/_img/shows/banner_9.jpg" alt="DBZ" /></p>

<p>It nothing compared to watching your favorite anime Dragon Ball and try to follow the super saiyan way of living. I have grown up watching this and want to live this awesome way my whole life. (Those good old times . I want to relive them :) ).</p>

<h2 id="6-go-to-sunburn">6. Go to Sunburn</h2>

<p><img src="http://api.ning.com/files/TkhfUmQ5jQeBvrt7BwlwlfuoI-h*ZVwGrUvpNTw8Oe0mRkussJQfM2Uu3J*fQT5FKlvAbya14hQJW5ILCE0IVGwV6nXzIeAg/DashBerlinLiveDJMixSetSunburnFestivalNoidaIndia.jpg?width=736" alt="Sunburn" /></p>

<p>There is nothing more exciting and thrilling and electrifying and startling &hellip;( :D )then jumping with your hands flying in the air to the EDM of your favorite DJ.</p>

<h2 id="7-complete-data-science-specialization-on-coursera">7. Complete Data Science Specialization on Coursera</h2>

<p><img src="http://bluecava.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DataScience.png" alt="DS" /></p>

<p>Back to study stuff. Data science and Big Data are kind off booms in the IT industry now days. There are by now 11 courses provided by coursera on the topic and I wish to complete them all.</p>

<h2 id="8-plant-a-start-up">8. Plant a Start-Up</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.adcglobal.org/images/blog/StartUP-header.jpg" alt="start up" /></p>

<p>As you guessed by the previous point, I am a techie person ( at least I consider myself as one ). It sounds thrilling and fun to start your own start-up. So just shut up and start-up.</p>

<h2 id="9-go-to-bangalore-for-an-internship">9. Go to Bangalore for an Internship</h2>

<p><img src="http://files.cluster2.hostgator.co.in/hostgator101219/image/asprzealinternship.jpg" alt="Internship" /></p>

<p>Tech internship and Bangalore. The perfect duo. Meet new and talented people and grow yourself as well. As far as I have heard it is a very fun experience.</p>

<h2 id="10-get-a-girlfriend">10. Get a Girlfriend</h2>

<p>This one is in because I was having no other thoughts in my mind and I didn&rsquo;t wanted the title to look like 9 things to do&hellip;
So if you are a girl, ping me! ;)</p>
