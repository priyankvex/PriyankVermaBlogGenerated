<p>My 6th book of the year was a handpicked one &ldquo;Outliers: The Story of Success&rdquo;. This book was actually recommended to me by my cousin as a &ldquo;must read&rdquo;. And actually I was amazed how great this book is. It takes your intellectual thinking to a roller coaster ride.</p>

<p>As the book description says :</p>

<blockquote>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?</blockquote>

<p>All the time we keep hearing success stories. We tend to see these successful guys as &ldquo;lucky ones&rdquo; or &ldquo;smart one&rdquo; or sometimes even as &ldquo;self-made millionaire&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This book will change your perception for success. It unlocks various not so obvious, highly backed with facts factors that actually make success happen.</p>

<p>When you were born to what you eat to what your ancestors used to do? It is pretty amazing how all of these can affect how successful you can become.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this book to everyone. A very good read.</p>

<p>Also as the 7th book of the year I have started reading &ldquo;How I Braved Anu Aunty and Co-Founded A Million Dollar Company&rdquo;. It is also a fun book to read but not a serious reading.</p>

<p>Will post review when done.</p>
