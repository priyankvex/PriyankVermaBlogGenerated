<p>Here it is. 4th book of the year <em><strong>Rafa by Rafael Nadal and John Carlin.</strong></em></p>

<p>Being arguably the biggest Rafa fan on this planet this book was in my reading bucket list from a long time. Finally got the opportunity to read this.</p>

<p>This is great in both sense, it gives you a more closer look into the life of your idol and at the same time shows you what does it take to be a champion? What does it take to be the best in the world at your sport? Rafael Nadal has the answers.</p>

<p>Book being the auto-biography tells how a small kid from Spain transformed himself into one of the world&rsquo;s greatest.</p>

<p>Reading this book you feel like you are inside Nadal&rsquo;s mind. You feel connected to him. You can feel his nerves while he discusses those crucial grand slam matches specially <strong>_The Wimbeldon. _</strong>You realize that the great Nadal is still a human yet what makes him very different is his grit, endurance and will to strive.</p>

<p>Nadal mentions many time the importance on endurance. That is what he was taught by Uncle Toni right from very young age.</p>

<p>My most favorite quote by Rafa is when he says &ldquo;If you flag once, you will flag again.&rdquo;  If you go easy on your dream once, you will 100% do that again. One morning you want to miss morning training because you were on a night out last night, you do it once you do ti again.</p>

<p>This book will really leave impression on your mind. If you want to be anomaly you must behave like one.</p>

<p>The day I am finished this book, Nadal lost to Fognini in US Open 2015 3rd round. Being 2 set up he lost for the first time in his career. What a devastating loss? But I am sure Nadal being nadal will come back.</p>

<p><em><strong>Vamos Rafa!</strong></em></p>

<p>Next book I started is _**Outliers : Story of success. **_Which will be 5th book for the 10 book challenge. An awesome read on what sets a successful person a part.</p>
