      <description>The best way to win is to show grit and bid on your strengths and intuitions. I have been trying to start my own company now for quite a some time. This course came into my mail box by edX, title looked captivating and thus I decided to take it.
It was a light course. Not much effort needed other that just watching the videos and doing some assignments.
The course was focused on making people get off with their venture from the idea phase to execution phase.</description>

      <description>Recently I was learning about Canvas and Custom views in Android and to put the theory in practice I made a pretty simple **Paint App. **
Source code of the app can be found https://github.com/priyankvex/Paint-App-Android.
[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_159&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;480&amp;rdquo;] Screenshot of the app[/caption]
The App is pretty simple with features 1. Create Drawings (Obvious one :P). 2. Select different brush sizes. 3. Eraser with different sizes. 4. Color pallet. 5. Save drawings in Gallery.</description>
