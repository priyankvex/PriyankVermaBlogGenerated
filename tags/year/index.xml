      <description>Time flies. Recently I had completed one year as a full-time employee at my current employer **Squad. **A year has passed, and I decided it was time to revisit instances, memories, and experiences and to recollect what I had learned as a professional in this past year.
It was also a wake-up call to reassess and redirect the ship named professional career to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in a whirlpool.</description>

      <description>Here are the 9 things I would love to incorporate into my life as I set myself to see the sun of 2018.
1. Stop chasing the long dream, start conquering the micro-goals: Start cultivating a passionate dedication to the pursuit of short-term goals, being micro ambitious. Putting my head down and work with pride, whatever is the job in the hand. If we see too far in front of us, we won&amp;rsquo;t see shiny thing right in front of us.</description>
