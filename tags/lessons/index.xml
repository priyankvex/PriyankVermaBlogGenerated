      <description>Preface Recently, I was browsing the codebase of my company and saw that it has three versions of dashboards for an analytics page in it. I am pretty sure that customers don&amp;rsquo;t need that. This sparked something in my naive brain and I started exploring the internet for related ideas. That&amp;rsquo;s when I found this age-old paper, A Plea for Lean Software.
This post is largely influenced by ideas presented in the paper that resonated with me.</description>

      <description>Time flies. Recently I had completed one year as a full-time employee at my current employer **Squad. **A year has passed, and I decided it was time to revisit instances, memories, and experiences and to recollect what I had learned as a professional in this past year.
It was also a wake-up call to reassess and redirect the ship named professional career to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in a whirlpool.</description>

      <description>Reading **The Alchemist **was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise, while the whole world slept.
The Alchemist doesn&amp;rsquo;t teach you anything, but you can learn a million things from it.
&amp;ldquo;Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for the lead, and then the lead will have to turn itself into gold.&amp;rdquo;
My 6th book of the year was **The Alchemist **by Paulo Coelho.</description>
