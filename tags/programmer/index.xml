      <description>Here we go for the 3rd time. My 3rd book for 2015&amp;rsquo;s 10 book reading challenge is _The Passionate Programmer. _
I picked this book from pragmatic programmer book shelf. All books listed there are awesome and are a must read. Anyways continuing with this book, it was an awesome reading experience. It was one of those books you wish to never end.
The author covers many aspects of what constitutes a not good but a great software developing career.</description>
