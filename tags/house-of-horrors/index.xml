      <description>Hi there. This post is to share my experience and work under getting started with &amp;lsquo;Responsive web design&amp;rsquo;. I created a website under the theme of House Of Horrors, and I am not even leaving my desk and posting this right away. Any suggestions are more then welcome!.As it was a project under &amp;lsquo;Responsive Web design&amp;rsquo;, so firstly what i did was, i created 3 wire frames of the website as high resolution, medium resolution and low resolution.</description>
