      <description>In the technology value stream, work typically flows from Development to Operations, steps consisting of functional areas between our business and our customers.

We increase flow by:
 1. Making work visible, 2. Reducing batch sizes and intervals of work 3. Building in the quality, preventing defects from being passed to downstream work centers.</description>

The next step was to take action, and while doing so, I have compiled few tips to make your engineering flow faster too.</description>
