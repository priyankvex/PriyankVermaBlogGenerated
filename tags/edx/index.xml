      <description>Single responsibility is a magical notion. Whatever it touches, it makes it more manageable and efficient.
With _Kubernetes, _we have the power to spawn many services. As many of them as we would like. But how inbounds requests are routed among these services?
_Ingressing _is a powerful way to decouple routing rules with core application logic.
According to kubernetes,
Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach to reach cluster services.</description>

      <description>What does it take to implement a educational technology? You have the idea that can supposedly change the world of ed tech and learning, but how to implement it?
Throughout the course, in the past 3 weeks I was constantly having my idea of creating an ed tech. With each passing week the course taught me something new which can be used to carve the idea even better.
By the end of 3 weeks I was having a very clear vision of what area of learning I have to target in my ed tech implementation, but again no technical knowledge was there on how to shape up the implementation wire-frame.</description>

      <description>Hi, guys. I am a very active participant of MOOC. In my previous post I shared my experience with LFS101x : Introduction to linux .And this time I am back with a new course.
It was summer of 2014, I was having my semester break. And 6.00.1x was on my enrollment list on edx. I was really excited to get started with it.
As this course says, it is meant for people with little to no programming experience, I was there having some programming experience but quiet a novice to python.</description>

      <description>It was this summer when I saw this course LFS101x being offered on edX by The Linux Foundation. Both the terms Linux and edX excited me . So I decided to take this course.
My experience with prior online courses I have taken few online courses on edX and coursera . In both the cases I loved the excitement and knowledge they provide. They were also fun learning and thus worked well for me.</description>
