      <description>It is a nice pleasant evening, you are sipping coffee and reviewing your code one final time, just so that you can gather enough confidence to hit the deploy button.
But a fact of life as a software engineer is that things can go wrong. Small changes may result in unexpected outcomes, including outages, errors or negatively impacting customers.
And when problems occur, either we can do random checks and validations that may or may not solve the problem or we can have a disciplined problem-solving approach that relies on data rather than intuitions.</description>

      <description>Organizations which designs systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structure of the organization.
In other words, how we organize our teams has a powerful effect on the software we produce, as well as our resulting architectural and production outcomes.
Thus, in order to get a fast flow of work from Development to Operations, with high quality, great customer outcomes and fast speed of delivery, we must organize our teams to bring the team structure to our advantage.</description>

      <description>Single responsibility is a magical notion. Whatever it touches, it makes it more manageable and efficient.
With _Kubernetes, _we have the power to spawn many services. As many of them as we would like. But how inbounds requests are routed among these services?
_Ingressing _is a powerful way to decouple routing rules with core application logic.
According to kubernetes,
Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach to reach cluster services.</description>
