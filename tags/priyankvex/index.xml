      <description>** Introduction**
Most software these days support undoing/redoing actions. For example, text editors support undoing what we have written, file managers support undoing file creation/deletion etc. It&amp;rsquo;s a good UX practice to make software forgiving and allow users to undo their actions.

Second month working on the startup I always wanted to do.</description>
