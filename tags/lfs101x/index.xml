      <description>It was this summer when I saw this course LFS101x being offered on edX by The Linux Foundation. Both the terms Linux and edX excited me . So I decided to take this course.
My experience with prior online courses I have taken few online courses on edX and coursera . In both the cases I loved the excitement and knowledge they provide. They were also fun learning and thus worked well for me.</description>
