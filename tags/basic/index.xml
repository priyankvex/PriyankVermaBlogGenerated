      <description>Time flies. Recently I had completed one year as a full-time employee at my current employer **Squad. **A year has passed, and I decided it was time to revisit instances, memories, and experiences and to recollect what I had learned as a professional in this past year.
It was also a wake-up call to reassess and redirect the ship named professional career to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in a whirlpool.</description>

      <description>Hi there,
This time would like to share my new project &amp;lsquo; A basic calculator built for the android platform.&amp;rsquo;
Creating android apps always seemed cool to me . Able to start learning to create one is even cooler.
This project uses simple things like XML layouts, Activities using java, Intents, OnclickListeners and some more basic concepts of java and android.
Below are the screenshots of the app running in both real android device and AVD.</description>
