      <description>Time flies. Recently I had completed one year as a full-time employee at my current employer **Squad. **A year has passed, and I decided it was time to revisit instances, memories, and experiences and to recollect what I had learned as a professional in this past year.
It was also a wake-up call to reassess and redirect the ship named professional career to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in a whirlpool.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been connected to a call where it was transferred to a third person for further assistance? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s call transferring.
Warm transfer of calls, in contrast to cold transfer, doesn&amp;rsquo;t disconnect the call in between and thus gives the customers a more seamless experience.
Recently at work, I was building a system to convert regular calls to a warm transfer if needed. And in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing what I learned while building the warm transfer system.</description>

      <description>It is a nice pleasant evening, you are sipping coffee and reviewing your code one final time, just so that you can gather enough confidence to hit the deploy button.
But a fact of life as a software engineer is that things can go wrong. Small changes may result in unexpected outcomes, including outages, errors or negatively impacting customers.
And when problems occur, either we can do random checks and validations that may or may not solve the problem or we can have a disciplined problem-solving approach that relies on data rather than intuitions.</description>
