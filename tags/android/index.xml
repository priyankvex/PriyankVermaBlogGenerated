      <description>Image credits Macoscope  MVP (Model View and Presenter) is an architectural pattern inspired by the popular MVC pattern.
MVP addresses two main points :
 1. Make views as dumb as possible. The dumber the better. 2. Make each layer loosely coupled and easily testable in isolation.  I am using MVP in one of my production project and have used in some dem0 apps. Here are my 5 notes on using MVP for android.</description>

Many applications in android use TextView that detects and highlight various string patterns like emails, phone numbers, web URLs and even hashtags.
This functionality is very common and and is used extensively and frequently in many app. Thus to ease the process of adding this functionality I have authored an Android library SmartTextView.

      <description>**Why the Series? **
(Inspired by book : Business In Blue Jeans)
Hi! This is Priyank. This series is about me pen downing my start-up ride. Don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s fast or slow, all I really know is I&amp;rsquo;m gonna enjoy the ride.
Why the name?
Boxers is what you&amp;rsquo;ll find me almost every time in and business is what&amp;rsquo;s always in my mind and thus the name &amp;ldquo;Business In Boxers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Only way to learn something is to learn it by yourself. Recently I have been playing with Canvas in android and it has been fun! :D
As they say knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in vegetable basket. And best way to persist new gained &amp;ldquo;wisdom&amp;rdquo; is to put it in use.
Practice Shapes is a fun app both for kids and grown-up kids (Yes.</description>

      <description>A polyglot developer will understand, there is always something you like about one language and you wish was available for another language too.
So, recently I started learning rails and found _number_helper _API very cool and fun to use. It gives you easy API to convert numbers into many formats like _number_to_human _which will convert 20000 to _20 Thousands _or number_to_human_size that will convert 1024 to 1 KB.
That was it I wanted this stuff for Android too.</description>

      <description>It is always fun to play with new APIs and tools. GCM is not something I was getting my hands on for the first time but it changed completely since last time I did a project using this.
But the good news is it has changed for good. New service classes makes it easier to write GCM clients for Android, GCM default configuration makes writing test servers and apps to play with very less tedious.</description>

      <description>Recently I was learning about Canvas and Custom views in Android and to put the theory in practice I made a pretty simple **Paint App. **
Source code of the app can be found https://github.com/priyankvex/Paint-App-Android.
[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_159&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;480&amp;rdquo;] Screenshot of the app[/caption]
The App is pretty simple with features 1. Create Drawings (Obvious one :P). 2. Select different brush sizes. 3. Eraser with different sizes. 4. Color pallet. 5. Save drawings in Gallery.</description>

Recently I was playing with OCR library by google called as &amp;ldquo;Tesseract&amp;rdquo; (cool name for a library!).
[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_153&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;234&amp;rdquo;] App in action.[/caption]
It was a fun experience. This post shows how you can make a simple OCR app in Android using Tesseract.
We will be using Tess-Two a fork of Tesseract with some additional tools like Liptonica which is an image processing library.
If you want an even easier way to get started with OCR on Android you can try this library built by me.</description>

If you ever tried to create an OCR app for Android you must have stumbled upon the OCR library by Google Tesseract. And then the problems began.
To use the library in your project you first need to build it. But building the library to be compatible with gradle, which is the new build system for Android projects is little not so easily stated anywhere in the library manual.</description>

      <description>Hi there,
This time would like to share my new project &amp;lsquo; A basic calculator built for the android platform.&amp;rsquo;
Creating android apps always seemed cool to me . Able to start learning to create one is even cooler.
This project uses simple things like XML layouts, Activities using java, Intents, OnclickListeners and some more basic concepts of java and android.
Below are the screenshots of the app running in both real android device and AVD.</description>
