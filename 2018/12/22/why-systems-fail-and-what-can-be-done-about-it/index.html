<p>A recent team meeting at <strong><a href="https://www.squadvoice.co">Squad</a></strong> touched the topic of <strong>&ldquo;system robustness&rdquo;</strong>. Clients and business operations want their systems to work, which is a very reasonable expectation. That&rsquo;s what we engineers are paid for after all.</p>

<p>Everybody gave their input over what a <strong><em>robust system</em></strong> means to them. The responses made two points very clear:<br />
1. There is an understanding gap in differentiating, robustness and availability of the system.<br />
2. People don&rsquo;t take the business domain into account when considering robustness and availability of the system.</p>

<p>Out of all the responses, one response caught my attention. It was,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;System should do, what it is expected to do&quot;&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This sparked my interest in the topic and made me research and explore <strong><em>why systems fail and what can we do about it</em></strong>?</p>

<h2 id="what-are-system-failures"><strong>What are system failures?</strong></h2>

<p>In simple language, a system failure occurs when it fails to do, what it was expected to do.</p>

<p>System failures are related to two properties of the system, &ldquo;Availability&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reliability (Robustness)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Reliability and availability are different: <strong>Availability</strong> is doing the right thing within the specified response time. <strong>Reliability</strong> is not doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p>So whenever a system fault occurs, we either compromise on the availability (system didn&rsquo;t respond in the specified time) or robustness (system didn&rsquo;t do the correct thing).</p>

<p>The domain that the system is deployed to serve dictates how much availability and robustness is required.<br />
Numbers like <strong>&ldquo;99% up-time&rdquo;</strong> are often misleading.</p>

<p>Availability of 99% means that the system can be <strong>down for 1.7 hours</strong> in any given week. How does this sound for a heart rate monitoring system in an ICU?<br />
Reliability of 99% means, 1 request can fail in every 100 requests. What if that 1 request is an update to a customers CRM that represented a deal size of 100000$ dollars?</p>

<p>This shows that there must be a strong relationship between the domain in which the system is deployed and the system failures that we can afford.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-design-systems-that-are-robust-and-available"><strong>How to design systems that are robust and available?</strong></h2>

<p>Hardware failures also contribute to system failures but with managed cloud services, the mean time between failures is in decades, most of the system failures occur because of software faults.</p>

<p><strong>Fault-tolerant execution</strong> of the software is the key in designing systems that are robust and available.</p>

<p>Though I&rsquo;m by no means an expert in this field, but few points that I have read and experienced may help in designing a more fault-tolerant software.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Software modularity through processes and messages:</strong></p>

<p>A key to making fault-tolerant software is to hierarchically decompose the software into modules, and modules into components. Each component is a unit of failure.<br />
A failure in a component should not be propagated to the other parts of the software.</p>

<p>A design possibility is to use <strong><em>messaging</em></strong> to make components talk to each other via Kafka etc. These messages can be replayed if they are not successfully processed by the component.</p>

<p><strong>2. Design modules to be</strong> <strong>fail-fast and sandbox faults:</strong></p>

<p>This relates to the idea of  &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://priyankvex.wordpress.com/2017/07/08/philosophy-behind-the-offensive-programming/">offensive programming</a></strong>&rdquo;.<br />
The modules and the components should be designed to fail-fast. Either they should function correctly or it should detect a fault and raise the signal.</p>

<p>The key idea here is to keep the fault detection latency low.<br />
If a component detects a fault early, they faulty state is not shared with other components via messages etc and thus <strong>faults are sandboxed</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Do effective checkpointing and make actions easy to retry:</strong></p>

<p>There is a hypothesis called as &ldquo;<strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">Heisenbug</a></em></strong>&rdquo;. It basically means that the fault-tolerance of the systems can be increased by simply retrying them one more time.</p>

<p>Imagine a software action failed because of a rare race condition occurred or some assertion failed or out of memory error. This can also be extended to cases when a request to some external service failed because their server was busy.<br />
In such cases, the system can recover from the fault by simply retrying the action.<br />
Making software easy to retry helps deals with such &ldquo;hesienbug&rdquo; or and &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_event_upset">single event upsets</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Effective checkpointing helps in making the actions not to be retried with &ldquo;amnesia&rdquo;.<br />
For example, if an action consists of two network calls and one of them failed, when the action is re-tried, we&rsquo;ll want the successful network request to not be repeated and be successfully checkpointed.</p>

<p><strong>4. Use transactions to maintain data integrity:</strong></p>

<p>Transactions help to keep the system state stored in the database in a consistent state.<br />
Though transactions don&rsquo;t directly contribute towards system&rsquo;s availability or robustness, as a software fault can still occur from within a transaction and sometimes even due to a transaction.<br />
But they do know how to **UNDO **the changes in the state if a fault occurs.</p>

<p>One more practical thing to do is to try coupling a DB write and a network call in a single transaction and this violates point 1, that&rsquo;s to keep the faults at the component level.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>Software faults do occur and no amount of testing and QA can prevent software bugs in production environments.<br />
Following certain system designing techniques and proper understanding of the &ldquo;availability&rdquo; and  &ldquo;robustness&rdquo; guarantees can help us create software that is highly available and fault-tolerant and always <strong>seem &ldquo;to do what it is expected to do&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
