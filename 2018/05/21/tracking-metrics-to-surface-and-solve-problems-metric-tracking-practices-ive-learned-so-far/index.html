  <h1>Tracking Metrics to Surface and Solve Problems: Metric Tracking Practices I&#39;ve Learned So Far</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-05-20T20:11:59Z class="post-date">Sun, May 20, 2018</time>
  

<p>It is a nice pleasant evening, you are sipping coffee and reviewing your code one final time, just so that you can gather enough confidence to hit the deploy button.</p>

<p>But a fact of life as a software engineer is that things can go wrong. Small changes may result in unexpected outcomes, including outages, errors or negatively impacting customers.</p>

<p>And when problems occur, either we can do random checks and validations that may or may not solve the problem or we can have a disciplined problem-solving approach that relies on data rather than intuitions.</p>

<h1 id="metrics-and-telemetry">Metrics and Telemetry</h1>

<p>To enable a disciplined problem-solving method, we need our software to track the right metrics and the right places. We need to design our systems so that they are continually creating <em><strong>telem</strong><strong>etry</strong></em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-telemetry">What is Telemetry?</h3>

<p>The DevOps handbook defines telemetry as,</p>

<blockquote>An automated communication process by which metrics are collected at remote points and are sent over to receiving equipments.</blockquote>

<p>When designing systems, it is a high leverage activity to include creating telemetry as a first-class citizen to enable and ease tracking metrics at all the levels needed, right from business level metrics to deployment pipeline level.</p>

<h1 id="levels-of-metrics-tracking">Levels Of Metrics Tracking</h1>

<p>As engineers, the software we write impacts the organization at multiple levels, from infrastructure to the product, to business. Thus, to resolve problems quickly, we need to track metrics all these levels.</p>

<p>Following levels of metrics have been really useful for me to keep a checklist for adding the right metrics in the software that I write.</p>

<h4 id="1-business-level-metrics">1. Business Level Metrics:</h4>

<p>These metrics directly affect the business. Thus are really imported to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Examples include sales transactions, numbers of items clients sent, total successful items processed, hourly processing rates, etc.</p>

<h4 id="2-application-level-metrics">2. Application Level Metrics:</h4>

<p>These metrics track the functioning of the application.</p>

<p>Examples include latency of the APIs, response time of queries, number of errors etc.</p>

<h4 id="3-infrastructure-level-metrics"><strong>3. Infrastructure Level Metrics:</strong></h4>

<p>These metrics track the infrastructure that runs our application.</p>

<p>Examples include CPU usage, available memory, IOPS spikes etc.</p>

<h4 id="4-product-level-metrics">4. Product Level Metrics:</h4>

<p>These metrics track the product progress and results. As product engineers, it&rsquo;s a high leverage task to track product-related metrics too.</p>

<p>Examples include A/B test results, feature toggling results, product progress, product extensibility, and configurability etc</p>

<p>By having telemetry coverage in all these areas, we will be to see the health of everything that our software relies on or things that rely on our software.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>With the limited time that I&rsquo;ve spent in the software industry, I&rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of metrics. Even the parts that don&rsquo;t involve any software must be tracked and measured. The key idea here is that you can not improve what you don&rsquo;t measure.</p>

<p>With right telemetry built into the software that we write, we&rsquo;ll be able to not only solve the problems they arise but also surface the latent ones before they catch fire.</p>
