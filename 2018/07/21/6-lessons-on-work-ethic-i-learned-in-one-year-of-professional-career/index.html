  <h1>6 Lessons On Work Ethic I Learned In One Year Of Professional Career</h1>

<p><img src="https://priyankvex.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/vagnini_101317_4227_hero_lg.jpg" alt="vagnini_101317_4227_hero_lg" /></p>

<p>Time flies. Recently I had completed one year as a full-time employee at my current employer **Squad. **A year has passed, and I decided it was time to revisit instances, memories, and experiences and to recollect what I had learned as a professional in this past year.</p>

<p>It was also a wake-up call to reassess and redirect the ship named professional career to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t get stuck in a whirlpool.</p>

<p>After all, our career is our responsibility and we all should make efforts to &ldquo;Own our story!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is going to be a list of 6 important lessons in professionalism and work ethic that I learned working as a Product Engineer at one of the most innovative startups in India.</p>

<h2 id="1-know-your-field">1. Know your field</h2>

<p>Do you know what a facade pattern is? Do you know what sprint and story points are? Do you know how to work your way with the debugger your IDE provides?</p>

<p>A wealth of ideas, disciplines, techniques, tools, and terminologies have decorated the last fifty years of our field. And if we want to be a professional we want to know a sizeable chunk of it.</p>

<p>The motto that I believe in is, &ldquo;If you want to see far, stand on the shoulder of the giants&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="2-continuous-learning">2. Continuous Learning</h2>

<p>The frenetic range with which the industry is changing, it means that we as engineers also need to learn colossal amount just to keep up.</p>

<p>Read books, read articles, watch talks. Keep adding deltas to your learning daily.</p>

<h2 id="3-practice">3. Practice</h2>

<p>This stuck me around 2 months back. Tennis is my favorite sport, and players believe that playing in the tournaments continuously actually makes their game less polished.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the deliberate practice of doing things right, which makes it gleamy again.</p>

<p>Is it true about our jobs also? Cutting corners to meet deadlines, working on the outdated stack at the company, working with legacy code, can all this make us less sharp.</p>

<p>At least I find it to be true, and practice to deliberately improve your craft is a vital component of one&rsquo;s work ethic.</p>

<h2 id="4-know-your-domain">4. Know your domain</h2>

<p>It is the duty of every software developer to understand the domain of the solutions that they are programming. If you are writing software for healthcare, get at least a basic understanding of healthcare, if you are writing for sales, know about sales.</p>

<p>Read a book or two on the domain, ask the domain experts.</p>

<p>We should be able to know enough about the domain to question the product direction and feature requests that we get.</p>

<h2 id="5-collaboration-and-mentoring">5. Collaboration and mentoring</h2>

<p>We all must make special efforts to collaborate, mentor and get mentored by other developers.</p>

<p>Whatever I have learned in this course of one year, a major portion of it due to learning from others.</p>

<h2 id="6-humility">6. Humility</h2>

<p>Programming is an act of creation. It feels like magic when we can write code that can do things that can produce tremendous value.</p>

<p>We all should take pride in our work, but never be arrogant about it. We should be confident in our abilities and take risks.</p>

<p>But we must know that we will fail. Things that we create will break, risks will be proven wrong and we will be called upon for these mistakes.</p>

<p>And when all this will happen, all we can do is be humble and take Howard&rsquo;s advice, <em>laugh and move on</em>.</p>

<h1 id="that-s-all-folks">That’s all, folks!</h1>
