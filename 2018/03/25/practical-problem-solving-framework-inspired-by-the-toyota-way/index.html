<p>We all will agree to a certain point that having a system/process for anything reduces chances of errors.</p>

<p>As an engineer or someone people look forward to propose solutions to problems it&rsquo;s beneficial to have a framework in place to solve problems effectively.</p>

<p>Recently I was reading _**The Toyota Way, **_and it suggested a framework to <strong>_Practical Problem Solving. _</strong>It almost felt trivial that this sort of framework would be invaluable to software engineers too (in fact for everyone).</p>

<p>When confronted with a problem, first we want to make it crystal clear and get a grasp of the real point of cause. That&rsquo;s followed by a series of 5 WHYs? to investigate the root cause. And finally countermeasures, evaluations, and countermeasures.</p>

<h2 id="1-initial-problem-perception">1. Initial Problem Perception</h2>

<p>Large, vague and complicated problem is presented. The first step is to perceive all the information available at this point information of time.</p>

<p>Ex. &ldquo;Hey! Metric X is showing incorrect value&rdquo;</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t show the actual problem, but just a perception of how some internal user saw it.</p>

<h2 id="2-clarify-the-problem">2. Clarify The Problem</h2>

<p>Next step is to clarify the problem to scope it down. Go and see the problem yourself. Analyse it and get a clear understanding.</p>

<p>As you are seeing the problem first hand, we want to gather as much information as possible.</p>

<p>Ex. So the entire analytics data was actually not consistent.</p>

<h2 id="3-locate-point-of-cause">3. Locate Point Of Cause</h2>

<p>Next step is to dig a little deeper and try finding the point fo cause.</p>

<p>Where is the problem observed? Where is the likely cause? This will lead us to the vicinity of the root cause, which we find in step 4.</p>

<p>Ex. Analytics system is working correctly, just that it sometimes doesn&rsquo;t get updated every 5 minutes like it&rsquo;s supposed to.</p>

<p>Here we rule out other possible causes, like a bug in the code or wrong data was tracked in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="4-ask-5-whys-investigation-of-the-root-cause">4. Ask, 5 WHYs? Investigation of  the root cause</h2>

<p>Here from the direct cause, we expose and go deep to the root cause of the problem by asking WHY five times.</p>

<p>Ex.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>1st why - Why was data inconsistent: Because analytics didn&rsquo;t get updated on time.</p></li>

<li><p>2nd Why - Why analytics were not updated on time - Because scheduled ETL jobs didn&rsquo;t run on time.</p></li>

<li><p>3rd Why - Why the schedule jobs didn&rsquo;t run on time - Because CPU usage was 100%</p></li>

<li><p>4th Why - Why CPU reached 100% - Because server instance size was not enough to handle increased number jobs.</p></li>

<li><p>5th Why - Why server size was not enough to handle the spike in usage -  Because our auto-scaling is slow.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By asking a series of 5 whys, we can generally get to the root cause of the problem and fix it there instead of just duct-taping it and be waiting for it to rise again.</p>

<h2 id="5-countermeasures">5. Countermeasures</h2>

<p>This step is fixing the root cause of the problem so that this doesn&rsquo;t come up again.</p>

<p>Ex. Moved to a more sophisticated auto-scaler to manage spikes in usages and setting up alerts to monitor the performance.</p>

<h2 id="6-evaluate">6. Evaluate</h2>

<p>After the countermeasure have been executed, it&rsquo;s important to evaluate the effect post that. Was the problem solved?</p>

<p>Ex. &ldquo;Now analytics are always in sync and even if they miss getting updated, we get an alert to know it beforehand and take action.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="7-standardize">7. Standardize</h2>

<p>This resonates with another Toyota principle of_** jidoka**, _meaning building in the quality.</p>

<p>How can we standardize the countermeasures such that similar problems are not faced again? How can we propagate our learnings across the organization?</p>

<p>Ex. &ldquo;Document and standardize the process that for all our instances and jobs proper alerts must be in place so that we know when they are malfunctioning&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was my take on how we can learn from a cross-discipline organization like Toyota on how to have a process and framework in place to solve problems effectively.</p>

<p>Afterall, problem-solving is supposed to be fun and having a proper framework in place, helps us keep it that way!</p>
